# Cache Clean — Manage Build Artifacts and Cache

Clean up Swift `.build/` directories, `.DS_Store` files, and other accumulated artifacts from Buddy Evolver worktrees.

## Steps

### 1. Preview what will be cleaned

Run a dry-run first to show the user what will be removed:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cache-clean.sh" --dry-run --verbose
```

Show the output to the user. Explain:
- Swift `.build/` directories are build cache (~33MB each) that rebuild in ~5 seconds on next use
- `.DS_Store` files are macOS Finder metadata with no impact
- The current worktree's `.build/` is preserved by default (mention `--all` if they want total cleanup)

### 2. Ask to proceed

Ask the user if they want to proceed with cleanup. If they want to also clean the current worktree's build cache, add `--all`.

### 3. Execute cleanup

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cache-clean.sh" --verbose
```

Or with `--all` if the user requested full cleanup:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cache-clean.sh" --verbose --all
```

### 4. Report results

Show the user:
- How much space was freed
- How many items were cleaned
- Remind them that Swift builds will recompile on next use (~5 seconds)
