# Token Review — Audit Plugin Context Footprint

Audit all context-loaded files in the Buddy Evolver plugin for token optimization opportunities. Produces a structured report. Optionally applies optimizations with `--apply`.

## Phase 1: Inventory

Measure every file that gets loaded into Claude's context window. Run:

```bash
cd "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
echo "=== Always Loaded ==="
for f in CLAUDE.md .claude-plugin/plugin.json .claude-plugin/marketplace.json .claude/settings.json .claude/settings.local.json; do
  if [ -f "$f" ]; then
    lines=$(wc -l < "$f" | tr -d ' ')
    chars=$(wc -c < "$f" | tr -d ' ')
    tokens=$((chars / 4))
    printf "%-45s %4s lines  %6s chars  ~%s tokens\n" "$f" "$lines" "$chars" "$tokens"
  fi
done
echo ""
echo "=== Loaded On Skill Invocation ==="
for f in skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  if [ -f "$f" ]; then
    lines=$(wc -l < "$f" | tr -d ' ')
    chars=$(wc -c < "$f" | tr -d ' ')
    tokens=$((chars / 4))
    printf "%-45s %4s lines  %6s chars  ~%s tokens\n" "$f" "$lines" "$chars" "$tokens"
  fi
done
```

Present the output as a formatted table. Calculate totals for always-loaded and per-skill.

## Phase 2: Checklist Audit

Read the optimization checklist:
```
Read ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/token-review/references/optimization-checklist.md
```

For each check (A1 through E1), evaluate the target file against the described pattern:
- Read the target file
- Search for the pattern described in the check
- If found: mark as **OPPORTUNITY** with estimated token savings
- If not found (already optimized or N/A): mark as **PASS**

Dispatch the `token-review` agent to perform the scanning if available. Otherwise, do the analysis inline.

## Phase 3: Report

Output the report in this format:

```
Token Optimization Report
═════════════════════════

Always-loaded baseline:    ~[N] tokens
Largest skill invocation:  [skill name] (~[N] tokens)
Worst-case session total:  ~[N] tokens

File Inventory:
───────────────
[table from Phase 1]

Optimization Opportunities:
───────────────────────────
[numbered list, sorted by savings descending]

1. [ID] [description]
   File: [path]
   Pattern: [what was found]
   Savings: ~[N] tokens ([%] of file)
   Action: [what to do]

...

Checks Passing:
──────────────
[list of IDs that are already optimized]

Summary:
────────
  Total recoverable:      ~[N] tokens
  Always-loaded after:    ~[N] tokens (currently ~[N])
  Largest skill after:    ~[N] tokens (currently ~[N])
  Reduction:              [%] always-loaded, [%] largest skill
```

## Phase 4: Apply (if `--apply` requested)

Only proceed if the user passed `--apply` or explicitly confirms after seeing the report.

### Pre-flight
```bash
cd "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" && git status --short
```
Warn if working tree has uncommitted changes. Ask user to confirm before proceeding.

### For each optimization opportunity:
1. Create the target reference file (if extracting content)
2. Edit the source file to replace inline content with a read instruction
3. Verify the edit:
   - Re-read the source file and confirm frontmatter, headings, and bash blocks are intact
   - Re-read the reference file and confirm extracted content is complete
   - Re-measure the source file to confirm token reduction

### Post-apply measurement
Re-run the Phase 1 inventory to show before/after comparison.

## Phase 5: Verify

After applying optimizations:

1. **Structural check** — for each modified SKILL.md, verify:
   - YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields exists
   - All original step headings (##) are preserved
   - All bash code blocks are preserved
   - Read instructions point to files that exist

2. **Functional check** — run the test-patch skill in dry-run mode:
```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-buddy-patcher.sh" --dry-run --species dragon --rarity legendary --shiny --emoji "🐲" --name "Test" --personality "Test"
```

3. **Diff summary**:
```bash
cd "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" && git diff --stat
```

4. Display rollback instruction: "To revert all optimizations: `git checkout -- .`"

## If No `--apply`

End after Phase 3 (the report). Remind the user they can run `/token-review --apply` to execute the optimizations, or apply individual items manually.
