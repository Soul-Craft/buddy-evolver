## How It Works

The plugin patches the Claude Code Mach-O binary to swap your buddy's species, rarity weights, shiny threshold, and ASCII art. It also writes your buddy's name and personality to `~/.claude.json`.

All patches maintain exact byte length to preserve binary integrity. The original binary is backed up automatically before any changes and can be fully restored with `/buddy reset`.

**Important**: Claude Code auto-updates replace the patched binary. Run `/buddy evolve` again after updates — your preferences are saved and can be re-applied instantly.

## Requirements

- **macOS** (uses `codesign` for binary re-signing)
- **Python 3** (ships with macOS)
- **Claude Code** (CLI version with Buddy feature)

## Uninstall

```
claude plugin remove buddy-customizer
```
