> Your buddy found a psychedelic mushroom 🍄 What happens next is entirely up to you ✨

Pick the species. Choose the rarity. Name it. Define its personality. Max out its stats. This isn't random evolution — **you design every detail**, then watch your buddy transform as if it was a Pokemon eating a psychdelic Super Mario mushroom 🍄

18 species 🧬 | 5 rarity tiers ⭐ | custom emoji 🎨 | your name ✏️ | your personality 💬 | your stats 📊

### 🎬 Here's what it looks like

**You choose everything:**

```
🍄 What species should your buddy evolve into?
  > 🐲 dragon — Fearsome fire-breather
    🐱 cat — Mysterious and independent
    🦎 axolotl — Adorable regenerating amphibian
    🦫 capybara — Chill vibes only

⭐ What rarity tier?
  > ✨ legendary — The rarest of the rare

🎨 What emoji represents your buddy?
  > 🐲

✏️  What should your evolved buddy be named?
  > Aethos

💬 Describe your buddy's personality:
  > Ancient dragon who mass speaks in mass riddles

📊 How should stats be distributed?
  > All maxed (99) — Every stat at maximum
```

**Then the magic happens:**

```
    ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
    ✨                ✨
    ✨       🐲       ✨
    ✨                ✨
    ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨

  Claude evolved into Aethos!

  ★ LEGENDARY            DRAGON

    Aethos
    "Ancient dragon who speaks in riddles"

    DEBUGGING  ████████████  99
    PATIENCE   ████████████  99
    CHAOS      ████████████  99

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have:

- 🍎 **macOS** — required (uses `codesign` for binary re-signing)
- 🛠️ **Xcode Command Line Tools** — provides Swift compiler and codesign; install with `xcode-select --install`
- 🤖 **Claude Code** — CLI version with the Buddy feature

---

## 🔧 Install

Run these commands **inside Claude Code** (not your regular terminal):

```
/plugin marketplace add Soul-Craft/buddy-evolver
```

Then

```
/plugin install buddy-evolver@soul-craft
```

Then restart Claude Code to activate the plugin.

This adds slash commands including `/buddy-evolve`, `/buddy-reset`, `/buddy-status`, `/test-patch`, `/security-audit`, and `/update-species-map`.

---

## 🎮 Quick Start

**Press START on your evolution adventure:**

1. 🍄 Run `/buddy-evolve`
2. 🎨 Design your buddy — pick species, rarity, emoji, name, personality, and stats
3. ✨ Restart Claude Code — your new companion appears

The whole process takes about 60 seconds. Every choice is yours.

To revert anytime: `/buddy-reset` 🔄

## 🕹️ Commands

### `/buddy-evolve`

Your buddy's evolution unfolds in four acts — like a classic RPG cutscene:

**🍄 Act 1 — Discovery.** Your current buddy stumbles upon a mysterious psychedelic mushroom, displayed with species-accurate ASCII art.

**🎨 Act 2 — Design.** Six customization steps where you control everything:
1. **🧬 Species** — Pick from 18 species (dragon, cat, axolotl, capybara, and 14 more)
2. **⭐ Rarity** — Choose a tier from legendary to common
3. **🎭 Emoji** — Any emoji to represent your buddy in the terminal
4. **✏️ Name** — Give your evolved buddy a name
5. **💬 Personality** — A sentence or two shown on the buddy card
6. **📊 Stats** — Max all, pick a preset (Chaos Gremlin, Zen Master), or set each individually

**✨ Act 3 — Evolution.** Confirmation summary, then sparkles fly as the binary is patched. Level-up complete.

**🎉 Act 4 — Reveal.** Your evolved buddy card appears with stats, personality, and rarity badge. Like opening a legendary pack.

All evolved buddies are ✨ shiny by default. A backup of the original binary is created automatically — your save file is always safe.

### `/buddy-status`

📋 Shows your current buddy as a visual card — like checking your character sheet.

- Works whether your buddy is evolved or not
- Shows rarity badge, stats bars, personality, and age
- Read-only — doesn't change anything

### `/buddy-reset`

🔄 Restores your original buddy by reverting all patches.

- Restores both the binary and `~/.claude.json`
- Safe to run anytime — does nothing if no backup exists
- Requires a restart after reset

### `/test-patch`

🧪 Dry-run validation of binary compatibility. Run this after Claude Code updates to check if the patching anchors still match.

Reports pass/fail for each patch type:
- 🧬 Species array
- ⭐ Rarity weights
- ✨ Shiny threshold
- 🎭 Art templates
- 💬 Soul (companion data)

If any fail, the plugin suggests running `/update-species-map`.

### `/update-species-map`

🔬 **Advanced.** Investigates the binary when anchor patterns break after a major Claude Code update. Searches for updated variable names and proposes code updates.

Most players will never need this — it's for when `/test-patch` reports failures.

### `/security-audit`

🛡️ Comprehensive health check for your buddy's integrity. Verifies:

- Binary backup exists and SHA-256 hash matches
- Codesign status is valid
- File permissions are correct
- Patch metadata is intact
- Anchor patterns still match the current binary

Run this if something feels off, or after a Claude Code update to make sure everything is still healthy.

---

## 🧬 Species

Choose from 18 species during evolution:

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🦆 duck | 🪿 goose | 🫠 blob | 🐱 cat |
| 🐲 dragon | 🐙 octopus | 🦉 owl | 🐧 penguin |
| 🐢 turtle | 🐌 snail | 🦎 axolotl | 👻 ghost |
| 🤖 robot | 🍄 mushroom | 🌵 cactus | 🐇 rabbit |
| 🐖 chonk | 🦫 capybara | | |

---

## ⭐ Rarity Tiers

Rarity determines how often your buddy reacts to your work — like a companion's chattiness slider:

| Tier | Reaction Rate | Vibe |
|------|:---:|---|
| **✨ Legendary** | 50% | Main character energy — reacts to everything |
| **💎 Epic** | 35% | Hype beast — always in the mix |
| **🔮 Rare** | 25% | Solid sidekick energy |
| **🌿 Uncommon** | 15% | Occasional words of wisdom |
| **🪨 Common** | 5% | The strong, silent type |

---

## 📊 Stats

Five RPG stats, each ranging 0–99. Choose a preset during evolution or min-max to your heart's content:

| Stat | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **🐛 DEBUGGING** | How tenaciously your buddy hunts bugs |
| **⏳ PATIENCE** | Tolerance for long builds and slow tests |
| **🌀 CHAOS** | Tendency toward creative mischief |
| **🧠 WISDOM** | Depth of sage advice offered |
| **😏 SNARK** | Sharpness of witty commentary |

**Presets:**
- 💪 **All Maxed** — 99 across the board, the power fantasy
- 🌀 **Chaos Gremlin** — 99 CHAOS, low everything else
- 🧘 **Zen Master** — 99 WISDOM and PATIENCE, inner peace
- 🎛️ **Custom** — Set each stat yourself, RPG style

---

## 🔬 How It Works

The plugin patches the Claude Code binary (a Bun-compiled Mach-O executable) to swap your buddy's species, rarity, shiny status, and ASCII art. Name and personality are written to `~/.claude.json` separately.

The important bits:

- 📏 All patches maintain **exact byte length** — like fitting new sprites into the same cartridge
- 🔍 Patterns are located by anchor searching, not hardcoded offsets
- 🧬 **Multi-version support** — the script stores multiple known variable maps and auto-detects which one matches the current binary at runtime. No manual updates needed when switching between supported versions.
- 💾 The original binary is **backed up automatically** before any changes — your save file is safe
- 🔏 After patching, the binary is re-signed with `codesign`
- ✅ Post-patch **binary verification** — runs `--version` after patching; auto-restores from backup if the binary is corrupted
- 🔄 Everything is fully reversible with `/buddy-reset`

---

## 🔄 After Claude Code Updates

Claude Code auto-updates replace the patched binary, which reverts your buddy to default. Don't panic — your buddy remembers who they are.

**To re-evolve:**

```
/buddy-evolve
```

Your preferences are saved, so re-application is quick — just confirm your choices and go. Like re-equipping your gear after a save reload. ⚔️

The patching script auto-detects which binary version you're running and uses the matching variable map — no manual intervention needed for supported versions.

**If patching fails after an update:**

1. 🧪 Run `/test-patch` to check which anchors broke
2. 🔬 If failures found, run `/update-species-map` or [file an issue](https://github.com/Soul-Craft/buddy-evolver/issues)
3. 💾 Your backup is safe and unaffected by updates

---

## 🩹 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>🔄 <b>My buddy didn't change after evolving</b></summary>

You need to restart Claude Code after evolution — like rebooting after installing a mod:

```bash
pkill -f claude && claude
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔏 <b>codesign failed</b></summary>

Make sure you're on macOS. Verify the binary path resolves:

```bash
readlink ~/.local/bin/claude
```

If the path is broken, Claude Code may need to be reinstalled.

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚠️ <b>Pattern not found / anchor warnings</b></summary>

Claude Code updated and the binary structure changed. Run `/test-patch` to check compatibility, then `/update-species-map` if needed.

Your existing buddy still works — only re-customization is affected until patterns are updated.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔁 <b>I want to change my buddy again</b></summary>

Just run `/buddy-evolve` again! No need to reset first — the script is re-runnable. Redesign as many times as you want.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🐧 <b>Can I use this on Linux or Windows?</b></summary>

Not currently. The plugin requires macOS `codesign` for binary re-signing after patching.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🛡️ <b>Is this safe? Can it break Claude Code?</b></summary>

The original binary is always backed up before changes — like a save state before the boss fight. Run `/buddy-reset` to restore it at any time. In the worst case, reinstalling Claude Code gives you a fresh binary.

</details>

---

<a id="uninstall"></a>

## 🗑️ Uninstall

If you've customized your buddy, reset first:

```
/buddy-reset
```

Then remove the plugin (inside Claude Code):

```
/plugin uninstall buddy-evolver@soul-craft
```

If you skip the reset, your customized buddy remains until the next Claude Code auto-update replaces the binary.

### Data flow

```
/buddy-evolve
  → Reads current buddy from ~/.claude.json
  → Collects 6 choices (species, rarity, emoji, name, personality, stats)
  → Calls run-buddy-patcher.sh --species X --rarity Y ...
  → Swift tool backs up binary, patches in-place, re-signs with codesign
  → User restarts Claude Code

/buddy-reset
  → Verifies backup integrity (SHA-256)
  → Copies backup over patched binary, restores ~/.claude.json
  → Re-signs binary
```

<a id="security-model"></a>

## 🛡️ Security Model

The plugin uses defense-in-depth across three layers to protect binary patching operations:

<details>
<summary>🔍 Layer details</summary>

**Layer 1: Swift input validation** (`Validation.swift`)

All user-provided inputs are validated before any write operation:
- **Emoji** — Single grapheme cluster, all Unicode scalars must be `.isEmoji`, max 16 UTF-8 bytes
- **Name** — Non-empty, max 100 chars, no control characters
- **Personality** — Non-empty, max 500 chars, no control characters
- **Stats** — JSON with known keys only (`debugging`, `patience`, `chaos`, `wisdom`, `snark`), integer values 0–100
- **Binary path** — Must exist, be a regular file, have Mach-O magic bytes

**Layer 2: Atomic operations and integrity**

- All file writes use `.atomic` option (`rename(2)` under the hood) — no partial writes on crash
- SHA-256 hash of original binary stored on first backup
- Restore verifies backup integrity against stored hash before overwriting
- Codesign failure after patching triggers automatic restore + exit(1)
- Backup directory: `0o700`; backup files: `0o600`

**Layer 3: Plugin-level enforcement**

- **PreToolUse hook** intercepts Bash calls to the patcher, validates for shell metacharacters (`;|&$\``), length limits, and `$()` subshell injection
- **Security audit skill** (`/security-audit`) provides on-demand integrity checking
- **Security review agent** reviews Swift code changes for missing validation, byte-length violations, and unsafe patterns

</details>

## 💻 Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Soul-Craft/buddy-evolver.git
cd buddy-evolver

# Build the Swift patcher (requires Xcode CLT with Swift 5.9+)
make build

# Run unit tests (178 tests across 12 files)
make test

# Run security validation tests
make test-security

# Run all tests
make test-all

# Install locally for testing (inside Claude Code)
/plugin install --local .
```

Run `make help` to see all available targets.

> **Tip:** The lazy-build wrapper `scripts/run-buddy-patcher.sh` compiles the Swift tool on first use. You don't need to build manually unless you're modifying the source.

---

## 🧪 Testing

**178 unit tests** across 12 files validate every component:

| Suite | What It Tests |
|-------|--------------|
| `AnalyzeTests` | `--analyze` mode binary introspection |
| `ArgumentParsingTests` | CLI flag parsing, unknown flag rejection |
| `BackupRestoreTests` | Backup creation, SHA-256 verification, restore |
| `BinaryDiscoveryTests` | Symlink resolution, error handling |
| `ByteUtilsTests` | Pattern search correctness, edge cases |
| `MetadataTests` | JSON serialization, file I/O |
| `OrchestrationTests` | End-to-end pipeline composition |
| `PatchEngineTests` | Species, rarity, shiny, art patching + idempotency |
| `PatchLengthInvariantTests` | **Byte-length equality** — the critical invariant |
| `RegressionTests` | One test per previously-fixed bug |
| `SoulPatcherTests` | `~/.claude.json` updates, missing file handling |
| `ValidationTests` | Input validation (emoji, name, personality, stats, binary) |
| `VariableMapDetectionTests` | Anchor detection, version compatibility |

**326 automated tests** across 9 tiers: smoke (13) + unit (178) + security (27) + integration (23) + functional (19) + UI (23) + e2e (23) + snapshots (6) + docs (14). Plus 34 on-demand tests (27 compat + 7 perf). See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the full testing architecture.

**CI** is local-first: `ci-quality.yml` runs on Ubuntu for every PR (shellcheck, JSON/YAML validation, hygiene checks). macOS-dependent tests run on contributor machines via `scripts/test-all.sh && scripts/upload-test-results.sh`; `ci-verify-local.yml` blocks merge until the upload appears and passes.

Run everything locally:

```bash
make test-all                   # all 9 tiers, emits test-results/results.json
scripts/upload-test-results.sh  # publish as GitHub Check Run on this commit
make coverage                   # local HTML coverage report → test-results/coverage/index.html
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome at [github.com/Soul-Craft/buddy-evolver](https://github.com/Soul-Craft/buddy-evolver).

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide — prerequisites, dev setup,
coding standards, testing expectations, and how to add new species or patch types.

For security issues, please use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Soul-Craft/buddy-evolver/security/advisories/new)
rather than opening a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details.

**Development workflow:**

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Run `make test-all` (or `swift test --package-path scripts/BuddyPatcher && bash scripts/test-security.sh`)
5. Open a PR against `main` — the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) will guide you

**Key constraints** — if you modify the Swift source in `scripts/BuddyPatcher/`:

- Every binary patch **must** produce output identical in byte length to the original — like fitting new sprites into the same ROM
- Use `findAll()` to locate patterns (never hardcode offsets)
- Add input validation in `Validation.swift` for any new user-provided arguments
- Use `.atomic` option on all `Data.write()` calls
- Add a `[DRY RUN]` branch for `--dry-run` mode in any new patch type
- Test with `--dry-run` before committing

**When updating for new Claude Code versions:**

- Check if anchor patterns still exist in the new binary (`/test-patch`)
- Variable names may change — update `knownVarMaps` in `VariableMapDetection.swift`
- Test with `--dry-run` first, then verify with the full test suite

CI enforces build + unit tests + security tests on every PR.
