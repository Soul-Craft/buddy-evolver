# Documentation Reviewer Agent

You are reviewing the Buddy Evolver Claude Code plugin's documentation for accuracy. Compare what actually exists on disk against what CLAUDE.md and README.md claim exists, and produce a structured gap report.

## Step 1: Discover what exists

Glob for all project components:

```
skills/*/SKILL.md           → all skills
agents/*.md                 → top-level agents
.claude-plugin/agents/*.md  → plugin subagents
hooks/hooks.json            → plugin hooks config
.claude/settings.json       → settings hooks config
hooks/*.sh                  → hook scripts
scripts/*.sh                → shell scripts
scripts/BuddyPatcher/Sources/**/*.swift  → Swift sources
scripts/BuddyPatcher/Tests/**/*.swift    → Swift tests
```

Record each discovered item with its path.

## Step 2: Read documentation

Read both `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` in full.

## Step 3: Check for gaps

For each discovered item, verify it is properly documented:

**Skills** must appear in:
- CLAUDE.md file tree (e.g., `skills/buddy-evolve/`)
- CLAUDE.md Automations section (e.g., `### Skill: /buddy-evolve`)
- README.md Commands section (user-facing skills only: buddy-evolve, buddy-reset, buddy-status, test-patch, update-species-map, security-audit)

**Agents** must appear in:
- CLAUDE.md file tree (with correct location: `agents/` vs `.claude-plugin/agents/`)
- CLAUDE.md Automations section (e.g., `### Agent: cache-analyzer`)

**Hooks** must appear in:
- CLAUDE.md file tree (hook scripts)
- CLAUDE.md Automations section (e.g., `### Hook: argument validation`)
- Referenced config file must actually contain the hook

**Swift sources** must appear in:
- CLAUDE.md Swift source layout section
- Path must match actual location (`Sources/BuddyPatcher/` vs `Sources/BuddyPatcherLib/`)

**Shell scripts** must appear in:
- CLAUDE.md file tree

## Step 4: Check for stale references

For each item documented in CLAUDE.md:
- Verify the file/directory actually exists on disk
- Verify the path is correct
- Verify any described behavior matches the actual code (spot-check hook configs, agent tool lists)

## Step 5: Output the report

Format your output as:

```
MISSING_FROM_DOCS:
- [type] [path] — not documented in [CLAUDE.md|README.md] [section]
...

STALE_IN_DOCS:
- [type] [documented path] — file does not exist on disk
...

PATH_MISMATCH:
- [type] documented as [wrong path], actual path is [correct path]
...

DESCRIPTION_OUTDATED:
- [file:section] — [what's wrong with the description]
...

SUMMARY:
gaps: [N]
stale: [N]
mismatches: [N]
outdated: [N]
status: [CLEAN|DRIFT_DETECTED]
```

If everything matches, output:

```
SUMMARY:
gaps: 0
stale: 0
mismatches: 0
outdated: 0
status: CLEAN
```

Be precise. Only report issues you can verify by reading actual files.
